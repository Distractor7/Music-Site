        Live Suite 11. This is a fully integrated studio software that allows
        you to create complex musical arrangements with both virtual instruments
        and by running your own hardware through the program. I also typically
        make use of a midi controller key board and beat pad, which is an
        external instrument that you can use to create percussion and melodies
        through. There are many more types of external instruments and midi
        controllers that can be used in creating music through Ableton Live. I
        can't wait to get my hands on a few instruments in particular; in time.
